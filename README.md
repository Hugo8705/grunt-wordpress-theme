# grunt-wordpress-theme
Wordpress theme with Grunt and Bower. Can actually be used also for HTML/CSS and templating.

## Installation

1. Clone the repo
2. <i>cd</i> to the folder
3. Run the <i>bower install</i> command to install the bower packages (Bootstrap, jQuery and Fot Awesome)
4. Run <i>bower list</i> to check for updated packages. Then run <i>bower-update</i> to update to the lastest version if necessary
5. Run the <i>npm install</i> command to install Grunt and necessary packages

## Using

The JS files get concatenated and minified in one file in public/assets/javascript

The LESS files are exported and minified in public/assets/stylesheets

You have to copy eventual fonts manually in public/assets/fonts

Some basics Wodpress template files are included. JS and CSS are included via <i>functions.php</i>

Image processing via the imagemin grunt plugin is currently commented the Gruntfile.js because I usually optimize my images manually.

## To do

Add the qUnit Javascript test support
